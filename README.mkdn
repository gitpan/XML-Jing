# NAME

XML::Jing - Validate XML files using an RNG schema using the Jing tool

# VERSION

version 0.01

# SYNOPSIS

	use XML::Jing;
	my $jing = XML::Jing->new('path/to/rng','use compact RNG');
	my $error = $jing->validate('path/to/xml');
	if(!$error){
		print 'no errors!';
	}else{
		print $error;
	}

# DESCRIPTION

This module is a simple interface to Jing which allows checking XML files for validity using an RNG file.

# NAME

XML::Jing- validate XML files against RNG using Jing

# METHODS

## `new`

Arguments: the path to the RNG file to use in validation, and a boolean indicating whether or not the given
RNG file uses compact syntax (false means XML syntax)

Creates a new instance of `XML::Jing`.

## `validate`

Argument: path to the XML file to validate 

Returns: The first error found in the document, or `undef` if no errors were found.

# TODO

Jing has more functionality and options than what I have interfaced with here.

Also, it would be nice to be able to get ALL of the errors in an XML file, instead of jut the first one.
